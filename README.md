# Robotic-Hand-
The aim of our Project is to make a Servo Motor Driven Robotic Arm which we aim to control in 3 different ways to model it’s applications in 2 different fields.

a)	Mirroring the movements of another Scale Arm 
  
 ۰ This method can be used in industries where there is a need for force multiplication and absolute precision is needed and a skilled human operator is present on site.
E.g.:  Precision Surgeries 

b)	Movements given by a Joystick:

۰ This method can be used in industries where there is a small margin of error inn the movements of the Arm, and when the environment is not suitable for a Human Operator’s physical presence.
E.g.:  Construction Sites.
